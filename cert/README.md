# CERT

Certs go here. If you're running your server with https you need to place two
files in this directory.

1. `ssl.crt` (If you're using letsencrypt this file will be /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem)
2. `ssl.key` (If you're using letsencrypt this file will be /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN/privkey.pem)
