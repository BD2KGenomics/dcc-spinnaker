The spinnaker validator needs to inspect uploaded files as part
of the validation process. For now, it straight-up downloads them.

After you checkout this repo, please populate this dir with two things:

1. your access token: put it in a file named accessToken

2. the unzipped ucsc-storage-client directory. The tarball can be
downloaded from:
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/beni-dcc-storage-dev/ucsc-storage-client.tar.gz
